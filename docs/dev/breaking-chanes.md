# dev: breaking changes

This project is intended to be used as a globally installed standalone CLI tool,
so the only changes that are categorized as "breaking" are effecting CLI-input or -output.

Changes on the dependencies, implementation or style are treated as "internal" changes.

Breaking changes *must* result in a new [MAJOR version](https://semver.org/).
